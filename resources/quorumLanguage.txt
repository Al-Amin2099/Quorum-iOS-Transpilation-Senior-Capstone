Evidence-Based programming is a scholarly project and the Quorum programming language puts it into practice.
Quorum is a broad, diverse, language with a large standard library, an active and engaged user base, and is
funded largely by the National Science Foundation. Today, there are several pieces of Quorum under active development,
including: a new development environment called Quorum Studio that provides new editors for text and gaming,
set of new library designs spanning a variety of domains (e.g., astronomy, math, gaming, robotics),
active curricular design efforts with partners (e.g., Code.org), and
teacher training efforts to help the community use it in the classroom.
Quorum is modified over time based on rigorous data collection made possible by my students and many other
excellent research labs across scholarship.
